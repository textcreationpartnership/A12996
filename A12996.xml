            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Firſt, by weakning of the ability of ſin; as by taking away all the occaſions to ſin, by remouing all the ſuſtein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſinne; by making a holy Couenant with euery member of our bodies and power of our ſoules, euer to to repell ſin, neuer to admit it; by which meanes it may come to paſſe, that ſin may be as a Lake, into which the current of no Stream runneth, which muſt needs be dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpp: as a Houſe without a foundation, which muſt needs be ruinated; as a Cittie beſieged without ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which muſt needs be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, it is done by oppoſing of his contrary vnto ſin, Charity to Mallice, Temperance and Sobriety to Gluttony and Drunkenneſſe, Liberality to Nigardiſe, Vigilancy to Security, Confidence to Diſtruſt, Faith to Infidelity, Truth to Leaſing, Chaſtity to Incontinency; and ſo of the reſt; by which meanes it may fall out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Vertue and Vice, as betwixt Chriſt and Satan; becauſe vice with Satan, as a <hi>ſtrong man man keepeth poſſeſſion of his Pallace, vntill Vertue with Chriſt, as a stronger man, commeth and ouer-commeth it, taketh away the armour thereof, and deuideth the ſpoiles.</hi> Luke, 11. 21. 22.</p>
            <p>Secondly wee ought to worke the ſupplanting of ſin by crauing of Aſſiſtance againſt it, A bleſſing like vnto that which <hi>Iſaack</hi> gaue vnto <hi>Iacob</hi> his ſon, euen the <hi>Dew of Heauen,</hi> becauſe it commeth downe from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. <note place="margin">Gen. 27. 28.</note> The meanes to obtaine it, is by <hi>Prayer in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and the benefitt of it is the <hi>Power of the ſpirit,</hi> euen the grace of GOD, before the which the Troupes of ſin can no more preuaile, then <hi>Dagon</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:177770:8"/> the Arke of God, which fell downe before it, hauing both <hi>Head and hands cut off.</hi> 1 Sam. 5. 4.</p>
            <p>Grace dealeth with ſinne, euen as the rod of <hi>Aron</hi> with the roddes of the <hi>Aegiptian Inchanters.</hi> Ezod. 7. 12. which deuoured them: or as the feathers of Eag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les are ſaid to doe with the feathers of other Birdes, which conſume them: If then Sinne, Hell, the Graue, and all the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So in the like caſe was the Seruant of <hi>Eliſhah,</hi> when hee ſaw the <hi>Horſes and Chariots of the Aramites compaſſing Dothan,</hi> vntill his Maiſter had <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto the Lord that he would open his eyes;</hi> and when his Eyes were opened, hee looked, and behold, the <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines were full of horſes and chariots of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As therefore at the prayer of <hi>Eliah fire came downe from heauen to conſume the burnt offering, ſo as the wood and ſtones, and the duſt was alſo deuoured, and the water in the ditch licked vppe.</hi> 1. Reg. 18. 38. So, lette vs with humble and deuout heartes pray for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly fire of Gods holy grace, wherby our vices may be conſumed, miſ-doings deuoured, and ſinnes ſupplanted.</p>
            <p>From theſe generall Doctrines, I am to deale with the particular branches of this <hi>Pſalme:</hi> and therein firſt, with the Euidence of the godly mans vertues, ſette forth vnto vs by the <hi>negatiue conteſtation</hi> thereof, in theſe wordes, that <hi>hee walketh not in the councell of the wicked.</hi> wher-out I may obſerue: 1. <hi>That there is a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of the wicked.</hi> 2. that the <hi>vngodly walk in it.</hi> 3. that <hi>the godly walke not in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, it appeareth then that there is a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:177770:9"/> of the wicked. This is eyther a councell which is Priuate in them-ſelues, or elſe Publike with others.</p>
            <p>The councell of the wicked, which is priuate in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, is a neceſſary precedency in euery wilfull and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſinne.</p>
            <p>In a wilfull and pretended ſinne. (as the Shoole-men ſpeake) Three things do meete and concurre together, <hi>Conſilium, Actus, Exitus.</hi> A councel, an act, an iſſue, vpon that Act let me inſtance this matter by ſome particular examples: <hi>Dauid</hi> after the walking on the roofe of his Pallace after the ſight of the beauty, and his ſurpriſe with the loue of <hi>Bathſhebah,</hi> firſt tooke councell in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, concerning an inquiry what ſhee was, and ſending of Meſſengers vnto her to moue her to come to him. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 3. 4.</p>
            <p>Secondly, committed the Act, and <hi>Lay with her. Ver. 4.</hi> Thirdly, the iſſue there-vppon inſuing, was, that <hi>Bathſhebah</hi> was conceiued with childe. <hi>Dauid</hi> for the ſaluing of his credit, was inforced to cauſe <hi>Vriah</hi> her husband to be murthered, that ſo <hi>Bathſhebah</hi> mought become his owne Spouſe; that <hi>Dauid</hi> beeing admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by <hi>Nathan,</hi> repented, and was abſolued from Spirituall, but not from Temporall puniſhment; but that the childe conceiued in adultery dyed: <hi>Abſolon</hi> his ſonne roſe vpp in Armes agaiſt <hi>Dauid</hi> his Father, and <hi>Deſtowred his Concubines in the open Sun-light. 2 Sam. Cap.</hi> 15. and 16. <hi>Ahab</hi> after the liking of <hi>Naboaths</hi> Vineyard, firſt tooke councell how hee might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe it, eyther by the <hi>exchange of another Vineyard,</hi> or <note place="margin">1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 21. 2.</note> elſe <hi>by giuing the worth ther of in money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the end becauſe hee could not ſo obtaine it by the aduiſe of his wife <hi>Ieſabell,</hi> hee tooke coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell alſo that Falſe Witneſſes might bee ſuborned againſt <hi>Naboath,</hi> that ſo <hi>Naboath</hi> might bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly <hi>Stoned</hi> for <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> and his Vineyard ſeazed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:177770:9"/> vpon to the Kings vſe, <hi>v.</hi> 8. 9. 10. Secondly, this was act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. 12. 13. Where they <hi>proclaimed a fast, and ſet</hi> Nabaoth <hi>among the chiefe of the people, and there came two wicked men and ſatt before him, and the wicked men witneſſed againſt</hi> Nabaoth, <hi>ſaying</hi> Nabaoth <hi>did blaſpheme GOD and the King: Then they carried him out of the Cittie, and ſtoned him with ſtones, that he dyed: And</hi> verſ. 16. Ahab <hi>roſe and tooke poſſeſſion of</hi> Nabaoths <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ineyard.</hi> Thirdly, the iſſue which followed here-from, was, that which was propheſied by the Prophet <hi>Eliah</hi> the <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite,</hi> that <hi>Doggs licked the blood of</hi> Ahab, <hi>euen in that place where they had licked</hi> Naboaths <hi>bloud,</hi> Reg. 22. 28. <hi>And in the field of Iezraell, doggs did eate the fleſh of</hi> leſabell, <hi>ſo that there was no more of her left then the ſcull, and the feete, and the Palmes of her hands.</hi> 2. Reg. 9. 35. The like might bee exemplified concerning <hi>Abſolon, Iudas</hi> and others, but for feare of being ouer-tedious: In all which it may appeare vnto vs: that the counſell of the wicked is the firſt egge of this venemous <hi>Baſilisk,</hi> Sinne prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the way for the Acte, as the Needle doth for the Thred; like the head of a <hi>Serpent,</hi> which if hee getteth in firſt, then draweth he all his poyſonous traine after him. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith in a certaine Sermon, <hi>Quare peccas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>farre from vs to thinke it. <hi>Quia cogeris vt facias? abſit:</hi> becauſe thou art compelled to do it? be it farre from vs to imagine it. <hi>Sed quia placet vt facias,</hi> but becauſe it pleaſeth thee ſo to doe. This pleaſure of ours that we will ſo doe, hath a neare alliance with <hi>the counſell of the wicked,</hi> which they priuately take in them-ſelues, the ſeed of this <hi>Colloquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida,</hi> the firſt head of ſinne.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is a counſell of the Wicked publique with others: This is either Temporall or Eccleſiaſticall.</p>
            <p>Temporall, one example for all is, that when <hi>Abſolon</hi> in his Inſurrection againſt <hi>Dauid</hi> his Father, with-all the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:177770:10"/> people the men of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> came to <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> Then <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolon</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. Sam. 16. 20</note> ſaid vnto <hi>Achitophell,</hi> euen in that bloudy and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall conſpiracie, <hi>giue Councell what wee ſhall doe.</hi> And hee gaue that wicked counſell concerning, <hi>Going in</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 21.</note> 
               <hi>to his Fathers Concubines.</hi> Secondly, there is a publike counſell of the wicked, in matters of aſſemblies Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall, as amongſt, and aboue, the reſt, that Councell which was aſſembled and gathered together for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning and executing our Innocent and guiltleſſe <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, Mark.</hi> 14. 55. where it is ſaid, that <hi>the high Priest and all the Councell, ſought for witneſſe againſt</hi> Ieſus <hi>to put him to death, and found none.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is an error in the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> by no friend of truth to be tolerated, that they ſo ſtiflye hold and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that Generall Councels cannot erre, and that Councels of the Church cannot prooue Counſels of the wicked. Indeed it is true of Councels of the Church, ſo farre as the Church continueth to be <hi>the piller and ground of truth.</hi> But by reaſon that Councells conſiſt of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3 15.</note> and Church-men are compounded of the Church, and Men, in many things, it cannot bee auoyded. But that as Men, they may and doe erre in regarde of their <hi>varietie of opinions, perſonall imperfections, multiplicity of interpretations,</hi> miſtaking, as <hi>Iſack</hi> (though he were a Prophet) miſtooke <hi>Iacob</hi> for <hi>Eſau.</hi> The difference is, <note place="margin">Gen. 27.</note> that <hi>Iſaac</hi> tooke the <hi>good Iacob,</hi> for the euill <hi>Eſau.</hi> But they here-in forſake the Good for the Euill.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The ſecond point which from hence I doe obſerue, is that <hi>the wicked walke in this Councell.</hi>

            <p>Secondly, the Company <hi>Concomitant</hi> in the way of the Righteous, are all they which liue at the ſame time with the Righteous in this preſent world, whom GOD hath ſo <hi>Predeſtinate before the World, As he hath called them out of the world:</hi> As hee may <hi>iuſtifie them in the world:</hi> And purpoſeth to <hi>gloryfie them after this Worlde: As Saint Auguſtine</hi> alledgeth alluding to <note place="margin">Auguſt.</note>

            <p>To him that trauelleth in the way, there is nothing more Delight ſome then to haue Good, there is nothing more Irkeſome then to haue bad Company: Behold here bee offered vnto vs, and ſette before vs two Wayes, The one of the Righteous, who haue Precedent, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant, and Subſequent good Company, as wee haue heard.</p>

            <p>The paſſage out of the way of the righteous is from Bondage to Liberty, from Pouerty to Wealth, from Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>On the other ſide, the paſſage of the wicked out of the way of ſinners, is from Liberty to Bondage; from Wealth to Pouerty; from Ioy to Sorrow, from Triumph to Teares, from Life to Death, from their Heauen in this world, to Hell in an other.</p>
            <p>It may then appeare vnto vs by that which hath beene deliuered, that the <hi>way of the righteous,</hi> is not vnlike vnto <note place="margin">2 Reg. 2. verſ. 19. 22.</note> the waters of <hi>Iericho,</hi> which were firſt bitter, and then made ſweete.

            <p>This Standing in the way of Sinners, implyeth with it an impoſſibility of Amendment, ſo long as they ſo ſtand.

            <p>The wicked then, in that they haue their ſtanding <hi>in the way of Sinners,</hi> are as a ſtanding puddle of corrupted waters, which the longer they ſtand ſtill, growe more and more corrupted.

As this hath beene ſaid concerning France: So doe I humbly bend the knee of my ſoule before the Throne of Gods Maieſty, praying both with the vtt-moſt and in-moſt zeale of my ſpirit, that it may not once bee ſuſpected of <hi>England.</hi> A brood of hell are they, not to bee confuted with wordes of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but to bee cutte off with ſwordes of puniſhment.

            <p>The ſecond thing that I am to handle, is that there is, <hi>A chayre of thoſe ſcornefull ones.</hi> The Scripture commendeth vnto vs a threefold Chayre, <hi>of Doctrine
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:177770:24"/> of Iuſtice, and of ſcorning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, of Doctrine, in this ſence, our <hi>Bleſſed Sauiour</hi> ſaith of the Scribes and Phariſies, that <hi>they ſitt in Moyſes chaire.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Math. 23. 2.</note> Teaching as hee taught in the ſame ſeate: but ſweruing from the puritie of his Doctrine, becauſe they taught with much corruption.</p>
            <p>Secondly wee read of a chayre, or ſeate of <hi>Iuſtice</hi> or <note place="margin">1. Reg, 10. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Iudgement,</hi> ſuch a one may that throne ſeeme to be which <hi>Salomon</hi> erected.</p>
            <p>Thirdly the Scripture mentioneth vnto vs a chayre, or <hi>ſeate of the ſcornfull,</hi> ſpoken off in this preſent <hi>Pſalme</hi> or place, <hi>Nor ſitte in the ſeate, or chayre of the ſcornfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Chayre is a place of eaſe and repoſe, wherein the Proud, Enuious and Malicious-men which ſcorne man; The Couetous, Carnall and Malicious men which ſcorne GOD, doe accuſtome them-ſelues to ſitte, euen as <hi>Herod</hi> ſatte in the ſeate of proud vanity, and as ſometime <hi>Babilon</hi> did, who vaunted that ſhee did ſitte beeing a <hi>Queene, and was no widdow;</hi> therefore in ſcorne <note place="margin">Act. 12. 21.</note> (as it were) of all that God could doe to her, <hi>ſhe ſhould ſee no mourning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third thing that I am to handle is, that <hi>the wicked ſit in this chayre or ſeat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſit in it, both as lewd Epicures, corrupting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and as falſe Doctors miſ-inſtructing others.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they <hi>ſit ſo in this ſeat,</hi> as they make it notorious vnto the whole world, that they are as lewd Epicures corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them-ſelues. They adde by all poſſible indeauour, Tranſgreſſion vnto ſinne, as ſome doe adde Drunkenneſſe to Thirſt; and when they haue ſo done, they ſitt them downe <hi>in the ſeate of the ſcornefull,</hi> that they may take their caſe there, yea it may be that they may fal a ſleepe there alſo.

            </p>
            <p>Theſe are they who haue their ſoules the more deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſinne-ſicke, becauſe they feele not them-ſelues ſicke at all. They haue as the <hi>Schoole-men</hi> ſpeake, <hi>Conſcientiam tranquillam, et malam,</hi> a conſcience quiet, but euil; like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an vncureable <hi>Fiſtula</hi> whoſe outward part ſeemeth ſound and cured, but the inward coare is rotten and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, ſuch as haue their conſciences <hi>ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp with a hot yron:</hi> ſo as all ſence is mortified in them.</p>
            <p>It is a point well worthy our obſeruing, that the more eaſe we thinke to finde in ſin, the further are wee off from any caſe at all. A Man that walketh, and becommeth wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of walking, thinketh to finde eaſe by ſtanding ſtill, but loe; ſtanding' ſtill, as we haue heretofore beene taught, is worſe then walking: A Man that is weary of ſtanding ſtill, ſuppoſeth to finde eaſe by ſitting downe: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, to ſitte downe maketh him in a worſe caſe then when hee ſtood: A man who is once entered into the way of ſinners, cannot gette out vnleſſe he walke: for as-much as when there is no mouing, there cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be any remouing from ſinne; and hee that ſitteth muſt firſt Riſe and Stand, before hee can Walke.</p>
            <p>He then that Walketh, hath but one ſteppe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, namely, <hi>comming forth:</hi> hee that Standeth, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue Two: <hi>walking and comming forth:</hi> but hee that ſitteth hath Three: firſt <hi>Standing,</hi> then <hi>walking,</hi> and in the end <hi>Comming forth.</hi> It is therefore a matter not of pleaſure, but of terror thus to ſitt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the wicked <hi>ſitte in the ſeate of the ſcorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> as falſe Doctors miſ-inſtructing others. This they practiſe eyther by <hi>Voyce,</hi> which ſeemeth to bee a ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king example: or by <hi>Example</hi> which may bee called a dumbe voyce.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing that I am to handle is, that the godly <hi>doe not ſitte in this ſeate.</hi> They doe not ſitte in it, firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becauſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:177770:25" rendition="simple:additions"/> they are carefull not to corrupt themſelues in this <hi>Epicurious</hi> eaſe, in ſecurity committing thereby, euen ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall crimes, and enormous tranſgreſſions. But they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the other ſide, beare a watchfull regard ouer euery part and member about them, that they may not offend or doe amiſſe: Ouer their Eares, that they may heare no vncleaneſſe: ouer their Eyes, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold no wantonneſſe: ouer their Hands, that they may doe no violence: ouer their Feete, leaſt the <hi>Miſ-going</hi> of any ſteppe ſhould prooue a <hi>Miſdoing</hi> againſt their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: and ſo conſequently ouer their whole, both out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inward man: that neyther may offend God, ſince both were made to ſerue God.

            </p>
            <p>Firſt, a <hi>Wandering thought,</hi> ſetteth (as it were) a falſe pias to the affections of the hearer. Whereby (when hee ought to attend his eare, and intend his minde to the VVord deliuered) he is miſ-drawn ſome other way. Thus the wanton neglecteth the VVord, and thinketh on his pleaſure: the Miſer on his coyne: the Drunkard on his cuppes: the Glutton on his diſh: the Prodigall on his game: the proud on his garments, his gate or his glaſſe; abuſing the preſence of GOD herein ſo much the more, in that <hi>VVhen GOD is a ſpirit and not a body. Iohn,</hi> 4. 24. they are preſent in body onely, and not in ſpirit.</p>

            <p>Oh with what willingneſſe doe wee heare matters in Ciuill Aſſemblies, at the <hi>Starre-Chamber,</hi> or ſuch like? though the diſcourſe of them be continued for ſome hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res together, beeing but the onely inuention of Man, and concerning matters Temporall, for this life alone: &amp; which happily appertain to other Men, &amp; not our ſelues; And ſhal we, who are of the Church of God, the true <hi>Starre-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> indeed; whereof the lower roome is the Church Militant heere on earth, hauing the Starrs to bee the roofe thereof abone; whereof the vpper roome is the Church Triumphant in Heauen, hauing the Starres to be as the Pauement therof below: ſhal we I ſay, be ſo dull eared? coldly affected? wandering-minded?

            <p>The ſecond thing is, the Paines that the Godly man taketh about the <hi>Law of the Lord,</hi> after his Pleaſure in this Law to be handled: <hi>And in his Law doth hee meditate day and night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein I may obſerue foure points.

            <p>Firſt am I then to ſpeake of the Practiſe of the paines of the Godly-One, in that hee doth <hi>Meditate.</hi> VVithout this <hi>Meditation,</hi> the Law of the Lord either in time wil be forgotten, whereby wee ſhall become vnmindfull of it; or elſe wil proue as a tallent wrapped vpp in a napkin and buryed in the earth, <hi>

            <p>This <hi>Meditation,</hi> it is the third ſteppe of a truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted and rightly informed Chriſtian. Whereof the firſt ſteppe is to heare the Word of GOD readily: the ſecond to Remember it dilligently: the third to meditate on it ſeriouſly. This <hi>Meditation</hi> or calling our ſelues to remembrance, is like that <hi>rumination or chewing of the cudde;</hi> to bee found in the <hi>cleane beaſtes,</hi> whereas <hi>They</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This Meditation it is as a Looking-glaſſe, or rather the very Eye of the ſoule whereby ſhee ſeeeth her ſelfe, and looketh into her whole eſtate, her riches, her pouerty, her giftes, her defects: her ſafety, her danger: her way, her iourney in the way, and the place where-vnto ſhee iournyeth.

            <p>Secondly, this Meditation would beat and beare downe the Monſter of Ambition, by pondering that though the Ambitious man be growing, ſo long as he is liuing, yet doth hee no more then the ſlimy and brutiſh Crocodile; that <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, and giueth grace, to the humble.</hi> Thus reſiſted hee proud <hi>Nimrod, Saul,</hi>

            <p>The firſt of theſe is the <hi>Vaine-glorious Epicure,</hi> who moſtly hunteth after thoſe pleaſures, which are grounded on a two-fold foundation, of the Backe, and of Buildings.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The third is the <hi>Drunken Epicure,</hi> who intertaines thoſe pleaſures which rather appertaine to the quenching of Nature, then of thirſt, by inceſſant and vnſtenchable quaffings: theſe are they <hi>who riſe vppe early to follow drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe and continue till night, till the VVine doth inflame them.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt is the <hi>Carnall Epicure,</hi> who is wholly ſold ouer to thoſe pleaſures which concerne the wanton dalliance of the fleſh, rather Swine then Men are they, delighting altogether to <hi>wallow in the mire of filthineſſe,</hi> reſembling the <hi>Centaures</hi> and <hi>Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taures,</hi> whoſe vpper partes were of Men: but the lower <note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22.</note> parts of Horſes and Bulles.</p>
            <p>But may (I beſeech you) in theſe pleaſures of Vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious, Gluttonous, Drunken and Carnall Epicuriſme, be found and inioyed, this ſound and ſolid <hi>Bleſſedneſſe</hi> which we ſeeke for? Oh nothing leſſe, and be it farre from vs once to imagine it.</p>
            <p>Firſt how can it bee lodged in Vaine-glory? whether it bee that Vaine-glory which concerneth the pride of our Backes, wherein though wee bee like vnto <hi>Salomon,</hi> yet are wee <hi>Short of the Lillies of the field,</hi> or whether it <note place="margin">Math. 6. 29.</note>

            <p>Secondly, how can it be contained in Gluttony? which as Saint <hi>Hieron</hi> ſaith, <hi>is an infernall fire, whoſe matter is ſuperfluity, flame, pride, ſparcles, vncleane ſpeeches, aſhes,</hi>

               <hi>pouerty, end, hell.</hi>

            <p>Fourthly, how can it be comprehended in the vncleane and wanton pleaſures of the fleſh? which begin in Luſt, proceed in ſhame, and (for the moſt part) end in Lepry and Contagion. Theſe pleaſures be a <hi>deepe Pit,</hi> and hee (not which is in fauour with the Lord) but <hi>with whome the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prou. 22. 17.</note>

               <hi>wee may finde,</hi> this true bleſſedneſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, therefore the world repoſeth the <hi>Chiefest bleſſedneſſe,</hi> in the good things of the <hi>Body,</hi> which though they bee many, yet our conſideration ſhall onely reſpect three of the chiefeſt of them, namely <hi>Beauty, Health, Strength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, concerning <hi>Beauty,</hi> it is excluded from beholding the true beauty of this bleſſedneſſe, whether it conſiſteth in the cleare brightneſſe of the skinne, which is named <hi>Pulchritude,</hi> or in the cleane making of the body which is called <hi>Forme;</hi> for how can that bee rightly graced with the name of bleſſedneſſe, which Nature the Hand-maide of <hi>God,</hi> ſo for the moſt part beſtoweth vpon the body, as it is accompanied with ſome defect in the minde? as they on the contrary ſide, who are black, deformed, lame, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:177770:42" rendition="simple:additions"/> in body haue therwithall ſome extraordinary Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinges in the mind <hi>like the Spirit of</hi> Eliah, <hi>which reſted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Kin. 2. 9. G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> 32. 25. 29</note> Eliſhah <hi>in a double portion. Or like to</hi> Iacob <hi>who halted and was bleſſed both together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly for Health it cannot ſuſtaine the perſon of true bleſſedneſſe, which if it ſhalbe continuall is rather a curſe then a bleſſing, as that which argueth rather Gods anger then his fauour, as that Godly <hi>Hermite</hi> made application to himſelfe, who hauing by an annuall courſe bin viſited in ſickneſſe by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hand of God, one yeare among the reſt find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an intermiſſion, lamented and wept as if that yeare had bin ouer-ſinful, and in that regard God had forgotten him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly Strength cannot rightly be eſteemed the price and crowne of <hi>true bleſſedneſſe,</hi> whether it be Naturall as that of <hi>Hercules,</hi> of <hi>Milo Crotoniata,</hi> or of <hi>Maximinus</hi> the <hi>Emperour,</hi> Which yet is ſhort of the ſtrength of an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, and therefore being in a greater meaſure in a beaſt cannot bee bleſſedneſſe in, or for a man: or whether it bee <hi>ſtrength ſupernaturall</hi> ſuch as was to bee found in <hi>Sampſon,</hi> for that was ſo vaine and brittle, (being taken Literally and not Typically) <hi>as the flattering tounge of a falſe harted</hi> Dalilah <hi>could betray it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly the world repoſeth the <hi>Chiefe Bleſſednes</hi> in the <note place="margin">Iud. 16. 17.</note> good things of the Minde, which paſſing by others of leſſe moment conſiſt principally in thoſe 3. <hi>Memory, Wit, Science.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Memory</hi> is a wonderfull and excellent bleſſing of God, which approcheth ſo neare God him-ſelfe, as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith <note place="margin">Plato.</note> that he which remembreth, all things, forgetten no thing, ſeemeth to be no Man But a God; yet the moſt that we can yeeld it, is to be a ſingular Bleſſing, not this Bleſſedneſſe, for how can that be adiudged Bleſſedneſſe, which affecteth Mans ſoule with Bitterneſſe? man by nature committeth more euill then good; the more perfect the memory is, the more perfectly doth it preſent and ſuggeſt vnto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to trouble the peace thereoff all the euil thoughts, words, &amp; deeds where with man hath ſtained himſelfe, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Man, and diſpleaſed God, ſo as vnleſſe his mercy
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:177770:42" rendition="simple:additions"/> doth pardon him, he muſt needs puniſh him. Memory muſt therefore remembrance her-ſelfe, that ſhee is vncapable of this <hi>bleſſedneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſharpneſſe of wit is a great poſſeſſion, but becauſe the wicked inioy it as well as the godly: and all men here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are farre out-matched by <hi>Deuills.</hi> I hope, with the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills,</hi> wee will exclude it from this true <hi>bleſſedneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Science</hi> alſo muſt haue her due and deſerued commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, whether it bee that part of her which is called <hi>Prudence,</hi> which ſitteth at the helmes of Monarchies, Kingdomes, Prouinces, Citties, and Corporations, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be that part which is termed <hi>Sapience,</hi> which either <hi>Metaphyſically</hi> preſſeth neare the knowledge of <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, of Angels and Spirits: or <hi>Phyſically</hi> ſearcheth the naturall cauſes &amp; motions of naturall bodies; or <hi>myſtically</hi>

All which, being moſt ample portions giuen by <hi>God</hi> vnto man; yet by man are to be debarred from this <hi>true bleſſedneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, who which is wiſe hearted, will account <hi>Prudence</hi> bleſſedneſſe, when hee ſhall conſider that it harboured in ſuch plentifull manner in <hi>Achitophel,</hi> as his Counſell was <note place="margin">Sam. 16. 23.</note> receiued as an Oracle of <hi>God:</hi> yet was it an occaſion to become his owne executioner, <hi>and to hang him-ſelfe.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Sam. 17. 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Sapience</hi> muſt be thought to fall ſhort of this <hi>bleſſedneſſe:</hi> becauſe Bleſſedneſſe is perfection, and <hi>Sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>The third of the fiue particulars, wherein this end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe conſolation doth conſiſt, which out of vs, ſhalll ariſe vnto vs in GODS Kingdome, is the place where wee ſhall enjoy it, euen in the Heauen, as witneſſeth the Apoſtle. 2. <hi>Corin. 5. 1.

            <p>The fourth of the fiue particulars, wherein this endleſſe conſolation doth conſiſt, which out of vs, ſhall ariſe vnto vs, in Gods Kingdome; is the practiſe wee ſhall there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe: Kings indeed we ſhal bee, and that of an heauenly Territory: but not carke and care, watch and ward, for the defence of ſubiects, and the offence of enemies, as the Kings of the earth vſe to doe; but ſuch Kings ſhall we be, <hi>As are coupled with Prieſtes.

            </p>
            <p>Hence may I further note (in a word) that the Spirit of God in this place ſaith concerning the <hi>Bleſſedneſſe,</hi> not preſently enioyed, but futurely to be reaped in the time to come: not that <hi>Bleſſed ſhall be-,</hi> but <hi>Bleſſed is the man:</hi> To ſhew that a Man that is eſpecially called Godly, quallified, and truely ſanctified, may be aſſured of this <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe,</hi> and by conſequence of his ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Seeing then to conclude by that which hath bene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, it appeareth that this <hi>True bleſſedneſſe</hi> conſiſteth in the ground-worke of Grace in this life, and is both buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on in Glory, and conſumate in the fulneſſe of Glory in the life to come: which conteineth in it a matchleſſe perfection both in Body and Soule within our ſelues; and alſo an endleſſe conſolation, ariſing both by the company of God, Angels, and Saints: by our ſtate, Kings, by our place the Heauens, by our taſke, ſinging the ſonges of Praiſe and thanks-giuing; out of our ſelues. Oh let vs in the name of Chriſt (in whoſe name alone we look to be ſaued) Let vs I ſay practiſe the vertues of the Godly, that we may receiue the reward of the Godly.

            </p>
            <p>Firſt then man by this ſimilitude is compared to a Tree. Sundry bee the reſemblances wherein man may bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto a Tree; but omitting other, my minde is onely to inſiſt in theſe foure vidz. The Shape, the Growth, the State, and the Trunke of a Tree.</p>
            <p>Man may firſt be ſaid to bee like a Tree in the ſhape, of a tree. As a tree hath his roote which is as his head, which groweth on to his ſtocke or trunke, which is as his Body, and then ſpreadeth it ſelfe into boughes and branches and ſmaller twigges: ſo Mans head is as his roote, which grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth into his body which anſwereth vnto a ſtocke or truncke, and then ſheddeth it ſelfe into armes and legges which bee as boughes and branches, which as in ſmaller twigge doe end in fingers and toes. The difference is that the roote or head of the Tree naturall ſtandeth in the earth and extendeth her Stocke, Boughs, and Branches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Heauen vpward, but Man (this miſtical Tree) hath his head as his roote ſtanding toward the Heauens and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpreadeth his body as his ſtocke or trunke, and his armes and legs as his boughes, and branches to the earth down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: to ſhew that as the materiall Tree receaueth that ſappe which is like vnto <hi>Eſaus</hi> bleſſing, <hi>the fatneſſe of the earth. Geneſ.</hi> 27. 39. ſo man this miſticall Tree ought to bee nouriſhed with that iuice which is like vnto the bleſſing of <hi>Iacob, the dewe of heauen. Geneſ.</hi> 27. 28. Man then is as a Tree but not as an earthly Tree: but as the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher ſpeaketh <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>An excellent ſhape is this of Mans body to informe him how to forme and faſhion his minde, to prouide that

            <pb n="104" facs="tcp:177770:55"/>
            <p>Seeing the Scripture in this place likeneth vs vnto trees, whoſe end (as wee ſee) is eyther to become building in the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> of his Kingdome; or elſe fuell for the ſulphury flames of Hell.</p>
            <p>Lette vs in the name of GOD, whoſe name is great, wonderful and holy: and in the feare of God, whoſe iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wee perceiue to be ſo grieuous and terrible, labour, as bleſſed beames, ſhining with the beames of moſt bright glory, to bee couched in the building of the Lord: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd to become as curſed brandes appointed to be ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the helliſh fire of euer continuing torments.

Oh how much more ought wee to dread (eſpecially beeing warned) that fire which is Immateriall and Vnquenchable: that ſo wee may not be as Trees appointed for Tinder in the Diuells furnace; but as Trees ordayned for Tymber in GODS Pallace.</p>
            <p>As hetherto wee haue heard Man compared to a Tree, ſo the godly man is not like vnto an ordinary or triuiall Tree of a common condition: but as it followeth in this Pſalme, hee is as a Tree, which firſt for the originall of it; is <hi>Planted.</hi> Secondly, for the ſituation of it <hi>[By the Riuers of VVaters:</hi> Thirdly for the fructifying of it <hi>[VVill bring forth her fruite in due ſeaſon:</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the flouriſhing of it <hi>[VVhoſe leafe ſhall not fade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt then this Tree is ſette downe vnto vs by the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of it. <hi>[Planted;</hi> It commeth not vppe then of the own accord, but as it is planted by Gods hand. If it came vppe of it ſelfe, then were it not of Gods planting, if it bee not of Gods planting, then muſt it bee <hi>Plucked vpp by the rootes:</hi> But it is otherwiſe with this Tree, which beeing in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:177770:55"/> the number of <hi>thoſe trees of righteouſneſſe,</hi> ſpoken of by the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> is with them in that place <hi>of Gods plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Eſay</hi> 61. 3. and therefore come not vp of it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine firſt diſableth and infringeth the free-will of Man, this misſticall Tree vnto good, becauſe he muſt bee planted, hee cannot plant him-ſelfe. Indeed Man at his firſt creation had free-will vnto good, but ſince his fall that bleſſing is fallen from him as writeth <hi>Saint Auguſtine, Male vtens predidit ſe et liberum arbitrium,</hi> Euilly vſing his free-will hee hath loſt him-ſelfe and his free-will, ſo <note place="margin">Angust. de libero Arbit.</note> that now it ſo ſtandeth with him that his Sweet is turned into Sower, his Righteousneſſe into Vnrighteouſnes his Light into Darkneſſe, and the Freedome of his Will to that which is Good, into a thraldome of the ſame into that which is Euill, in ſo much as though it mought then bee ſaid of him <hi>potuit non peccare,</hi> hee could not haue ſinned, yet now it muſt bee ſaid of him, <hi>non poteſt non pecare,</hi> hee cannot but ſinne. The truth of this point may appeare vnto vs by the proofe of a plentiful argument</p>
            <p>Firſt, what good can bee willed by him? who being conſidered as hee is a meare naturall man, is as a dead man: <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes. Ephe. 2. 2. Colo.</hi> 2. 3. ſo dead as to bee made aliue hee muſt <hi>bee borne againe. Iohn. 3. 3. yea created againe. Ephe.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what good can bee expected from him as a fruit of his Free-will therevnto? who is wholy prone vnto, and totally poſſeſſed with that which is euill. <hi>The immagination of mans heart is euill, euen from his</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 8. 21.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Whereout I may obſerue vnto you: firſt that man is euill; ſecond that the heart of man the fountaine of all his actions is euill; third that the imaginations of that heart the ſtreames (as it weare) and riuerettes deriued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from are euill: fourth euer, euen from his youth vp. Which being neceſſarily ſo, becauſe the Scripture hath a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>irmed it to bee ſo: what I beſeech you, is left in man
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:177770:56"/> that is ſound? Yea what is there left in him that is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound?</p>
            <p>The like teſtimony wee finde, <hi>Roman. 5. 8. They which are after the fleſh, ſauour the things of the fleſh.</hi> Sauour the things of the fleſh; that is, the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>their wiſedome,</hi> which ſhould be moſt ſauoury in them, is become fleſhly, that which ſhould be moſt ſauory in them, is corrupted. If that which is moſt ſauory in man, euen his beſt partes, is fleſhly and corrupted? What may we then conclude con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that which is almoſt vnſauory in him, but that it is moſt defiled, polluted, vncleane?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the proofe of this point appeareth by the <hi>Conteſtations</hi> and Witneſſe-bearing euen of the Gentiles them-ſelues, who no doubt having deriued the ſame from the bleſſed fountaine of the Scriptures, doe auouch and teſtifie the truth of this matter. To omitt the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due I will inſiſt on the Authority of two of the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt of them. <hi>Plato</hi> writeth that vertues are in-bred in men, <hi>afflatu numinis</hi> by the inſpiration of the god-head. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plato. Ariſt. Ethi. lib.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth, <hi>Si quod donum dei eſt, faelicitatem illud eſſe ſtatuendum eſt, &amp;c.</hi> If there be any thing which is the gift of God, we muſt determine that to bee Faelicity, or Bleſſedneſſe. But this Bleſſedneſſe, is no other thing (ſaith he) but the beſt action which proceedeth from the beſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the mind: But how? <hi>Per virtutem praeſtantiſſimam,</hi> by the beſt Vertue, which beſt Vertue cannot properly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate any other thing vnto vs; But God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the ancient and moſt flouriſhing times of the Church, hath both affirmed and confirmed, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and proued the ſoundneſſe of this Truth: That Man of him-ſelfe cannot plant him-ſelfe in any good courſe, as may be made manifeſt vnto vs both by Counſels and alſo by the wrightings of the moſt <hi>Orthodoxall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church.</hi>

Let vs not therefore preſume on the ſinewes of our ſtrength; as if therby, wee could make our ſelues good: neither yet truſt to the wings of our own worthineſſe, as if we therby could mount into heauen: for how ſhall we be able being borne aloſt with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſicke feathers o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, water hath no colour in it, ſo the worde of GOD is and ought to bee with-out gloſſe. The word of God is and ought to bee like God himſelfe, <hi>with-out coulour or ſhadowe.</hi>

            <p>If the Water hath any colour, it is that moſt ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which it receiueth from the skye, whoſe colour it, for the moſt part, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Fourthly, Water quencheth heate: ſo the worde of God alſo reſtinguiſheth the heate of our ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thirdly, it may appeare vnto vs, by the putting out of the ouer-hott paſſion of praepoſterons zeale, which if it bee not alayed with knowledge, will prooue like <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> who forth-with would <hi>haue commanded fire fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen to haue conſumed the Samaritans:</hi> &amp; where as in the <note place="margin">Luke. 9. 53.</note> ſame place they alledge the example of <hi>Elias,</hi> our <hi>Sauiour Christ</hi> made anſwer vnto them, that their ſpirit was diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that of <hi>Elias,</hi> for they knew not (which no doubt was knowne to <hi>Elias) what ſpirit they were of.</hi> Luke 9. 55.

            <p>Fiftly and laſtly, Water doth fructifie and make fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thoſe places which bee watered and drenched by it: An example of this matter wee haue in <hi>Nilus:</hi> The inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of whoſe ſtreames, fructifieth, euen to this day the whole country of <hi>Aegipt,</hi> in which ſence moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly in this place, the word of God is to be accepted, and thereof to abound with fruite, or to fructifie in aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.

            <p>Firſt, this Tree is ſaid to bee <hi>Planted</hi> by thoſe waters, which for <hi>their quality are a riuer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two remarkable properties be obſerued in a Riuer, firſt that the guiſe thereof is to flowe forth without ſtanding.

Thirdly, what things are to be performed: this is Sanctity. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what things are to bee ſuſteined: this is the Perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance here required, which is euen the ſiſter of Patience, and can no more bee ſeparated from her, then a man

            <p>The ſecond motiue or reaſon which may perſwade vs to this perſeuerance, it may be drawne from the nature of Religion, a vnity of ſpirit, to bee found in one body the Church; depending on one ſpirit <hi>the holy Ghost:</hi> one Lord <hi>Christ Ieſus,</hi> one Faith, one Baptiſme, one <hi>God and Father of all, which is aboue, through all, and in all.</hi> If then Religion <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. from verſ. 3. to 7.</note> be but one: the Truth one, the Church, Spirit, Lord, Faith, Baptiſme, and <hi>God</hi> him-ſelfe but one; then vnleſſe wee minde to caſt off all piety and religion, and be found figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters againſt God, in that wee open our mouthes againſt heauen, in denying there is a God; Wee are ſo in God and godlineſſe to proceed; ſo to perſeuer, as wee haue begun.

            <p>The fourth branch of the fructifying of this Tree, is Opportunity <hi>in due ſeaſon.

            <p>For this cauſe hath God made vs his Stewards, that wee ſhould diſpoſe of his bleſſinges to the good of others; the Magiſtrate by gouerning, the Miniſter by teaching, and euery particular man in his particular calling by doing that hee doth not, as the <hi>Machiauell</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lititian</hi> of this world to his owne priuate good: but if hee bee the Sonne of GOD, ought hee to bee like the Sunne of the World, which hauing receaued that rich portion of light without which all thinges ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in darkeneſſe, ſhineth not for it ſelfe which ſeeth nothing, but to and for others, and thoſe not the good alone, but the bad alſo?

            <p>Firſt the <hi>Leafe</hi> of Hypocrites, is that which alwaies is to be found alone without fruits: whoſe <hi>Speach</hi> is feigned without ſincerity: and whoſe <hi>Behauiour</hi> is counterfeite without integrity.

            </p>
            <p>The Saints then are like <hi>Nathanaell,</hi> whom <hi>Chriſt ſawe vnder the Fig-tree: a true Izraelite, in whome there was no guile:</hi> But the Hipocrites like the Fig-tree it ſelfe, which <note place="margin">Ioh 1. 47. 48.</note> Chriſt found, hauing nothing, <hi>but leaues, Matth. 21. 19.

            <p>In an Hypocrite the Leaues are great but the fruit none at all, but in a Saint the leaues are ſmall and the fruit great. The Saintes indeed are not altogether without their Leaues there outward ſhew, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>O then how fearefull a thing is it to bee Trees, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth Leaues without fruit, with the Hypocrites! for then not onely the Leaues, but the Trees alſo themſelues, by the fearefull yet moſt iuſt iudgement of God, as proud <hi>Ieſabell,</hi> and her painted face, ſhall both of them periſh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.

            <p>Oh let vs then, ſeeing it is the pleaſure of G O D S ſpirit to call vs by the name of Trees, not become ſuch Trees as haue a ſhewe of Leaues onely without the ſubſtance of fruite, therein as Hypocrites, leaſt that God meete with vs in the extreame rigor of his ſharpeſt iudgement, <hi>not onely to ſhake of our leaues, Ieremy. 8. 13. but euen to lay an Axe to the roots of ſuch trees to cut them

But let vs rather ſtriue with the beſt ſtraine of our might, to prooue our ſelues ſuch <hi>trees,</hi> which ſhall produce Leaues of ſhew, coupled and accompanied with fruites of ſubſtance, therein as <hi>Saints:</hi> that ſo God may deale with vs in that louing kindneſſe, which may not onely conſerue our fruite, that it may become liuing <hi>like the fruite of the tree of life:</hi> but alſo, that our very <note place="margin">Apocal, 22. 2.</note> Leafe may not onely bee durable to continue, but medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinable alſo to doe good, as the <hi>Leaues</hi> of that <hi>Tree</hi> there mentioned, according to the truth of this Text; <hi>whoſe leafe ſhall not fade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond part in the ſimilitude, it is the <hi>adiection,</hi> or part <hi>ſubſequent, [So whatſoeuer hee doth shall proſper.</hi>

            <p>Firſt then, touching the further Declaration or Dilata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the recompence of the Bleſſed man, <hi>Hee shall proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> Hee ſhall bee in the houſe of God, as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in the houſe of <hi>Putiphar,</hi> ſo aſſiſted by the Lord, as what-ſo-euer hee doth <hi>shall proſper in his hand.</hi> Though the World la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour <note place="margin">Geneſ. 39. 3.</note> to procure him aduerſitie, yet ſhall the Lord bleſſe him with proſperity. This was the eſtate of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who though hee were a man of warre, not onely becauſe hee made warre againſt his enemies; but alſo becauſe an army of troubles made warre againſt him: as the Beare, the Lion, the malice of his Brethren, the perſecution of <hi>Saul,</hi> the ſtrength of <hi>Goliah,</hi> the rayling of his Subiects, the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:177770:75"/> inſurrection of his owne Sonne, together with many other calamities, yet was hee not vnder the burthen of all theſe croſſes depreſſed and quenched; but rather as one that <hi>proſpered and grew.</hi> And no maruaile, for the reaſon thereof in the ſame place is added, becauſe <hi>the L O R D</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing is, how he proſpered, <hi>So, &amp;c.</hi> that is: as <hi>the Tree planted, &amp;c.

            <p>Hearing and Doing muſt goe together, like vnto thoſe
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:177770:76"/> couples, <hi>Gen. 7. 2. male and female.</hi> Hearing ought to go before, as the <hi>male</hi> to beget, and dooing ought to follow after as the <hi>female,</hi> to conceiue, bring forth, and bee fruitfull.</p>
            <p>If wee would bee <hi>holy Children,</hi> wee muſt, firſt, <hi>heare;</hi> Secondly, <hi>bring forth fruite:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>as the planted Roſe.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>by the brookes,</hi> not of our incloſed and priuate Gardens, but of <hi>the open and publike fields,</hi> where the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitt may redound, to the benefit, not of ſome, but of <note place="margin">Eccle. 39. 13.</note> many.</p>
            <p>To heare the Word gladly, is to commence no higher degree in the Schoole of Chriſt then <hi>Herod</hi> did, <hi>Mar</hi> 6. 20. But if wee will bee proficients, graduates indeed: ſo as wee may <hi>come home with true ioy,</hi> which <hi>Herod</hi> was neuer acquainted with: <hi>wee muſt bring our sheaues,</hi> that is, our Fruites with vs. Wee muſt not onely practiſe to <note place="margin">Pſal. 126. 7.</note> heare, but here to practiſe. Hearing, without practiſing, what elſe will it do, but adde more number to our ſtripes? <hi>That ſeruant which knew his Maiſters will, and prepared not him-ſelfe, neither did according to his will, shall bee beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> What elſe will it doe, but adde more <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 47.</note> weight vnto our condemnation? to this end our Sauiour breaketh forth into this denuntiation of iudgement. <hi>Woe hee vnto the Corazin: Woe bee vnto the Bethſaida, for if the workes which were done in you, had beene done in Tyre and Sidon, they had repented long ſince in Sack-cloth and Ashes: but I ſay vnto you, it shall bee eaſier for tyre and Sidon in the day of Iudgement, then for you, Matth,</hi> 11. 20. 21. On the other ſide: Hearing to practiſe, bringeth with it a member of true Bleſſedneſſe, the proſperity here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. <hi>His dooings shall proſper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth and the laſt thing is, what dooings of his ſhall proſper, not ſome, but all his dooings: <hi>Whatſoeuer hee doth shall proſper: whatſoeuer, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which, that it may the better appeare vnto vs, we muſt know, that the dooings of a Godly man, are ſuch as hee

            <p>The dooings of the godly which hee vnder-taketh in Action, they bee either his Vertues or his V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Firſt, he may bee ſaid to proſper in his Vertues. Theſe be they which will cauſe God <hi>to lift vp the height of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance vpon vs;</hi> a thing prayed for by <hi>Dauid.

As if Gods Iudgement had beene enthralled, where his mercy was engaged. <hi>Lotts</hi> righteouſneſſe had that <hi>interest</hi> in Gods mercy, that it procured (as it were) a <hi>ſuperſedeas</hi> for his Iuſtice, <hi>I can do nothing vntill, &amp;c.</hi> Seeing then the Vertues of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous are wholye ſtated in the mercies of G O D, their dooings (as in this place) muſt needes <hi>bee proſpered.</hi> Let holye <hi>Iob</hi> further exemplifie this pointe vnto vs,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:177770:77"/> who before it pleaſed God to trye him (as for their good hee dealeth with all his children) is ſayd ſo in his iuſt courſes <hi>to bee proſpered,</hi> as that, <hi>an hedge was made about him, and about his houſe and about all that hee had on euery ſide, and that God had bleſſed the worke of his hand, and his ſubſtance was increaſed in the land. Iob.</hi> 1. 10. His vertuous actions, as the vertuous actions of the righteous were <hi>proſpered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly (which haply may ſeeme ſtrange) he ſhal proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in his Vices. This proſperity accrueth vnto the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man from his Vices; not <hi>ſimply</hi> but <hi>reſpectiuely:</hi> not in regard of the <hi>beeing</hi> or <hi>exiſtence</hi> of the Vice, but of the <hi>dependance</hi> or <hi>conſequence</hi> thereupon: not in reſpect of the act, but of ſomethinge deriued from the act.

            <p>Firſt, muſt bee aſſumed vnto our handling the <hi>Introdue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> into the matter. <hi>The wicked are not ſo.</hi> The ſpeech is <hi>negatiue</hi> and excludeth the wicked from al that which the ſpirit of God in the fore-going part of this <hi>Pſalme</hi> hath witneſſed concerning the Godly, both touching the <hi>Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of their Vertues, and the <hi>Recompence</hi> for there Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Euidence</hi> of the Vertues of the Godly in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue</hi> part of it was, <hi>that they walke not in the counſell of the wicked, ſtand not in the way of ſinners, ſit not in the ſeate of the ſcornefull,</hi> but it is <hi>Affirmatiue</hi> in the wicked which is <hi>Negatiue</hi> in the Godly, becauſe, they walke in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the wicked, ſtand in the way of ſinners, and ſit in the ſeat of the ſcornefull.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Euidence</hi> of the vertues of the Godly in the <hi>affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue</hi> part thereof, was that <hi>there delight was in the Lawe of the Lord, and in his Law doe they meditate day and night,</hi> but it is <hi>Negatiue</hi> in the wicked, which is <hi>Affirmatiue</hi> in the Godly; for there delight is in nothing leſſe then in <hi>the Law of the Lord.</hi> Neither doe or will they meditate therein, either night or day.

            <p>Theſe doings or actions conſiſt (as before wee haue heard) eyther in that which they vnder-take, <hi>faciendo,</hi> by doing, or elſe in that which they vnder-go, <hi>patiendo,</hi> by ſuffering.</p>
            <p>Thoſe actions which the wicked vnder-take <hi>faciendo,</hi> by doing, let them be obſerued, in their Vertues (ſo abuſiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called) and in their Vices.</p>

            <p>Theſe their vertues are done by the wicked firſt, for ſhew, as <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> like a dung-hill couered with ſnowe, white without, but full of ſtench and pollution within.

            <p>

            <p>Thirdly, theſe their vertuous actions are done by the wicked for their owne good, conſiſting eyther in Profit, or in Praeferment, like Polititians.</p>

               <hi>Should fall downe and worſhip him.</hi> This likewiſe is the caſe of all the wicked, which are of <hi>their Father the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,</hi> Who will helpe vppe ſome-what (inwordly pollicy) the ſtate of them which are downe; to the end they may helpe their owne eſtate vpp. But theſe vertuous
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:177770:82"/> doings of theſe vngodly dooers cannot be proſpered: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt will ouer-throw ſuch <hi>Mony-changers</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, which change ſmall, that they may gaine great ſummes of money; as ſome-time hee ouer-threw <hi>the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There exaltation ſhall prooue like an <hi>Exhalation,</hi> mounting aloft, and forth-with turned into <hi>lightning, which ſhall bee cast downe;</hi> the eſtate of Sathan him-ſelfe, and the lotte of his followers, who was ſeene to <hi>fall as lightning from Heauen, Luk.</hi> 10. 18. Therefore though the <note place="margin">Luk, 10. 18.</note> vertuous actions of the godly <hi>ſhall proſper,</hi> yet may it bee ſaid of the vngodly, <hi>The wicked are not ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the dooings of the wicked, are thoſe which hee vnder-taketh, <hi>faciendo,</hi> by action, reſpecting his Vices. Seeing his vertues haue beene found to haue no better ſucceſſe, his vices can much leſſe bee expected to bee proſpered. The vices of the godly, not <hi>ſimply</hi> but <hi>reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely,</hi> were ſayd to proſper, becauſe they lead him to a ſpeedy, wiſe, and wary repentance. But with the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is farre other-wiſe: hee knoweth not what repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance meaneth. Hee may ſay of repentance (the worke of the Holy-Ghoſt) as thoſe <hi>Diſciples of Epheſus</hi> ſayd of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> him-ſelfe: that they <hi>had not ſo much as heard whither there were an Holy-Ghost or no.</hi> They know well <note place="margin">Act. 19. 2.</note> what belongeth to the returning vnto ſinne but are who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of that which concerneth the turning away from ſinne. Therefore theſe actions of the wicked, Oh how can they proſper! Yea alaſſe, how can they bee but defaced, diſproſpered!</p>
            <p>In them is rather to bee found bitterneſſe, then ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; diſprofit then profit, as may appeare vnto vs by a ſummary view of theſe particulars: Arguments that <hi>they cannot proſper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt is, that the Vice of the wicked by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:177770:82"/> practiſe of it, hardeneth the heart of him that practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it. Hence it is, that they which would bee called, (though they deſerue it not) <hi>the Children of Abraham, become as ſtones hardened,</hi> as <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 9. we read of ſtones, whome God is <hi>able to raiſe vp,</hi> that they may bee <hi>the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Abraham.</hi> This maketh the <hi>fleſhy tables of their</hi>

                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>hearts,</hi> to be as <hi>the tables of ſtone,</hi> in which were grauen not the ſweet comforts of the Goſpell, but the affrightfull ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Lawe. It maketh the ground of their heart to become <hi>as ſtony ground,</hi> which cauſeth <hi>the ſeed of the word</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 13. 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>ſowne</hi> thereon to parch and wither. A ſtony heart, which being throughly hardened by the cuſtome of ſinne, proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth more impenetrable then the <hi>ſtony rock in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Rodde of Moyſes</hi> ſmiting this rocke, ſo mollyfied the ſtifneſſe thereof, as it became as a liuing Fountaine, to yeeld water to the thirſty <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> but, not the Rodde of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> but the Scepter of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <note place="margin">Exod. 17. 6.</note> ſmiting not once, but often, not on the <hi>ſtony Rocke of Horeb,</hi> but on the rockie ſtone of our hearts, is ſo farre from mollifying it, as it rather prooueth like the Adamant, of which ſome ſay, that the more it is beaten vpon, it is ſtill more and more hardened.</p>
            <p>The ſecond point, whereby the bitterneſſe and diſprofit of the wicked (which commeth by the actions of their vices) may appeare vnto vs, is the guilt and galling of Conſcience, which continually recordeth and ſuggeſteth vnto them their ſinne committed, Gods lawe violated, his Maieſty offended, puniſhment deſerued, &amp;c. And are in the ſoule, as <hi>Antiochus</hi> wormes were in his bowels, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually gnawing.

            <p>The third point, whereby the bitterneſſe and diſprofit of the wicked (which commeth by their actions of vices) may appeare vnto vs, is the Angering of GOD thereby. Sinnes be the cauſe of Gods anger, becauſe they bee the only <hi>Vanities which prouoake him to anger.

As there is a depth of Gods Wiſedom, ſo is there of his Wrath, which deſcendeth from the ſurface of the earth to the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Mountaines, and from the foundations of the Mountaines, to the bottome of hell: a Wrath, which in the 42. verſe of that Chapter is called by the name <hi>of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and a ſword:</hi> of Arrowes which kill, <hi>eminus,</hi> a farre off, and of a ſword which woundeth <hi>cominus,</hi> neare hand.

               </gap>e fourth point, whereby the bitterneſſe and diſprofit of the wicked, which commeth by their vicious actions, may appeare vnto vs, is, that they are no true <hi>poſſeſſors,</hi> but <hi>vſurp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The fifth point, whereby the bitterneſſe and the diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the wicked, which commeth by their vic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, may appeare vnto vs, is that they ſhutt them out of Gods kingdome; for whereas there is <hi>a bleſſedneſſe</hi> for them which doe Gods Commandements, <hi>by entering in through the gates into the Citty:</hi> the wicked, <hi>which are as</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The ſixt point, whereby the bitterneſſe and diſprofit of the wicked, which commeth by their actions of vices, may appeare vnto vs, is that they Preſſe them downe (without repentance) to hell.

            </p>
            <p>The ſecond ſort of actions of the Wicked, bee thoſe which they vnder-goe, (with the Godly, not as the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) <hi>patiendo,</hi> by ſuffering. Wherein we may finde the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of them-ſelues, vnder the carriage of their burthen, to be diuerſe, yea aduerſe from that of the Godly. For be it that their neckes once bee yoaked, or their backes burthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with loſſes, croſſes, afflictions, perſecutions, torturings, tormentings, fire, gibbet, renting of members, racking of bones, &amp;c. fore-mentioned in the Godly. What doth it I beſeech you, beget and produce in them? but among other diſapproueable, yea reprooueable effects, as they which are vtterly deſtitute of the fellowſhip of that ſpirit which is called the <hi>comforter,</hi> theſe two <hi>furies</hi> rather then <hi>fruites,</hi> Impatiency or Deſperation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it begetteth and produceth in the wicked Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie. It fareth with them, vnder this manifold burthen of the Croſſe, as it did with <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> who is ſayd to bee an <hi>Aſſe,</hi> ſtrong indeed (as the Text there ſpeaketh) as thoſe men alſo ſeeme to bee in the outward view of the world, yet, <hi>couching betwixt two burthens,</hi> Gen. 49. 14. ſo vnder many burthens, not able to ſuſtaine them.</p>
            <p>From the bitter fountaine of this Impatiency floweth a two-fold vnwholſome and vntoothſome ſtreame:</p>
            <p>The one of Pining away of the wicked them-ſelues: the other of Repining againſt God their maker.</p>
            <p>The Pining away of them-ſelues cannot bee auoyded, foraſmuch as their darkneſſe is without light, their ſowre with-out ſweet: their ſorrow without ſolace, their croſſes
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:177770:84"/> without comfort. For any eaſe they can finde, within, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, aboue, beneath, before, behinde, on either hand. or round about them, may be ſaid to bee (alaſſe) a miſerable comfort, as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaid of his friends, that they were <hi>miſerable comforters.</hi> Their trouble is like fire in a Furnace, which <note place="margin">Iob. 16. 2.</note> finding no vent, waxeth furious in it ſelfe, increaſing the meaſure of the owne heate, beyond all meaſure, ſo theſe finding from no meanes, or place, the deſired iſſue of any conſolation, rage againſt and within them-ſelues, like <hi>Saul,</hi> who no doubt, when in his moody Melancholy, the <hi>euill ſpirit was vpon him,</hi> was, <hi>ipſe ſuum cor edens,</hi> as one <note place="margin">1.

            <p>The ſecond Fury rather then Fruite, which by ſuffering and croſſes, &amp;c. is begotten and produced in the wicked, is Deſperation, as in <hi>Saul, Iudas, Achitophell,</hi> with diuerſe others alledged in Hiſtories, both <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall,</hi> may appeare vnto vs, who bearing the croſſe on their backes, haue impatiently runne a deſperate race, the goale whereof haue beene the wracke of their owne liues, wrought by the worke of their owne hands.

But while hee was thus puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed vp with the winde of vanity, the inuiſible <hi>winde</hi> of <hi>Gods iudgement</hi> ſeazed on him; a winde indeed, becauſe as a winde, it was heard and felt, but not ſeene; Hee ſawe nothing, but hee heard a voyce from heauen, ſaying, <hi>O King</hi> Nabucchad-nezzar, <hi>to thee bee it ſpoaken, thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is departed from thee,</hi> verſ. 28.

            <p>Secondly, the quality of the winde is, to bee ſwift in his courſe, ſo the <hi>Iudgement of God</hi> commeth ſwiftly, when it commeth, for it is as a <hi>winged booke which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth flying.</hi> Zacha. 5. 1. as the <hi>winde</hi> it ſelfe is ſayd to <hi>haue wings.</hi> Pſalm. 18. 10.

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, the quality of the <hi>winde</hi> is to bee impatient of reſiſtance: for where it findeth it ſelfe moſt oppugned, there the power of the <hi>winde</hi> is moſt oppoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> againſt the high Mountaines, tall Cedars, lofty Pines, and ſpyred Turrets or Pinnacles, &amp;c.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:177770:93"/> in ſo much as Thunderings and Lighnings (as that Father mentioneth) wrought the confuſion of there worke, and fire from heauen (in a moſt ruful and feareful manner) conſumed the worke-men, ſo as they were conſtrayned to deſiſt from there worke, As the Winde therefore is <hi>the Iudgement of God,</hi> moſt Impatient, where it findeth moſt Reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Fiſtly the quality of the Winde is, though it bee Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fearefull and furious, yet to bring good effectes Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally with it.

            <p>Behold then the eſtate of the wicked, what place or preferment ſoeuer they haue, what port or pompe ſoeuer they beare among men, yet their hope (which when it fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all thinges ſeeme to faile with it, as that which is the laſt refuge of a diſtreſſed ſoule) their hope I ſay, is but <hi>like the dust which is blown away with wind, and like a thinn ſcumme which is ſcattered abroad with the ſtorme, and as the ſmoake diſperſed with winde.</hi> Wiſe. 5. 14.

            <p>Where was this <hi>Aſſembly of the righteous</hi> at that time elſe to bee found but in the houſe of godly <hi>Iacob?</hi> Yet euen then therein were many imperfections. <hi>Ruben</hi> his eldeſt ſonne inceſtuous: <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Leui</hi> murtherers: <hi>Dinab</hi> his daughter a wanton; and all betrayers of their brother <hi>Ioſeph.</hi>

            <p>The Church of God, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 9. is compared to the Moone, the Moone firſt receiueth her light from the Sun: ſo doth ſhe from her Husband <hi>Chriſt the ſun of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> Secondly, the Moone (of all thoſe heauenly bodies) is <note place="margin">Mala. 4. 2.</note>

            <p>Thirdly, the Moone is eclipſed by the interpoſition of the earth betwixt the Sun &amp; it: ſo the Church of God (no doubt) is ſom-what blemiſhed by the interpoſition of the eatrthhy members of our fleſhly concupiſcence, betweene the graces of Chriſt and it. Fourthly, the Moone hath her ſpottes; ſo hath the Church of God her blemiſhes.</p>
            <p>The Mone then (wee may ſee) for one benefit that ſhee hath receiued, in that ſhe is made glorious with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beames of the Sun, hath a threefold inconuenience, that ſhee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſom-what be tainted by the earth being the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt caeleſtial body vnto the earth: that ſhe is eclipſed and obſcured by the putting betweene of the earth betwixt the Sun and hir: that ſhe hath hir ſpots in her, to ſhew, that if the church here ſiguified by the Moone hath any good, ſhe hath it not from her ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but from Chriſt, as the

            <p>The firſt of the three is of neceſſity for their being: the other two, <hi>de bene eſſe,</hi> for their well being. The one, for the well being in the Common-wealth againſt Idleneſſe and want, The other for their well being in the Church, againſt Sinne and Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>The way naturall or of generation of the righteous, neceſſary to their being, is that which is both of their birth into this world, and life in this world. A thing is this common to them with all men, not onely with them, who
